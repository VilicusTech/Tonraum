                    <h2>Who I am</h2>

                    <p>A long time ago, I had a vision of an Audio company that would produce high-end studio gear for artists, voice actors, musicians, and content creators. 
                    <br> <br> And here we are today, at <b>Tonraum</b>.
                    <br> <br> My name is <b>Alex</b>, and on the 12th of Janurary 2025, I had the idea to turn my passion of Audio, Music, and anything related into this, <b>Tonraum</b>. 
                    We are a German company <em>(Moin, meine Deutsche Freunde!)</em> based in New Zealand, but hopefully not for long. I will go over it more below, but we operate
                    under the idea that Audio Quality should be paramount in the aforementioned scenarios, and we are here to provide those who need it, with <em>(somewhat)</em> afforable
                    equipment, ranging from Dynamic, Condenser, and Ribbon Microphones, to Studio-Monitor Headsets and Speakers.   
                    </p>

                    <section class="divider"></section>

                    <h2>Our Principles</h2>

                    <p>We operate under the idea that good Audio Quality should not be kept behind an absurd price tag. While our gear will not be cheap enough
                    to be in the same price range as other gear, like Anko or <a href="https://fifinemicrophone.com" style="text-decoration: none; color: #5900ce;">FiFine</a>, it also will not be so expensive as to be mythical to purchase, 
                    like <a href="https://www.neumann.com/en-us" style="text-decoration: none; color: #5900ce;">Neumann</a> or <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-ASIA" style="text-decoration: none; color: #5900ce;">Shure</a>.
                    <br><br>On that note, We try our absolute best to rival and even out perform these expensive Microphones, and Audio Quality is our personal Garuntee.
                    If a product is provably broken upon first usage, Email us, send it back, and we will provide you with a replacement, free of charge <em>(except shipping sorry)</em>.
                    </p>

                    <section class="divider"></section>

                    <h2>Our Funding and Goals</h2>

                    <p>Lets be transparent here, about our funding of course. It all comes from <b>Me</b>. This is an entirely self funded project, in the hopes that we make enough 
                    for the company to overtake the funding. In the meantime however, it all comes directly from my accounts, be it R&D, Production, or anything of the likes.
                    It comes with benefits though, like knowing exactly where the money is going, and being able to be transparent like this.

                    <br><br>Now, onto our goals.

                    <br><br>Being completely honest, my only goal is any more than 5 orders in 2026. Just knowing that a select few people out there
                    are enjoying my work, and gear, is enough for me. On a larger scale, the end goal is a known brand-name in the Audio scene. That's it. 
                    That's all I want from this silly little project.
